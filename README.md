## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & How It‚Äôs Built
This portfolio is built as a **fast, maintainable static web app**.  
Every layer was chosen for simplicity, performance, and long-term reliability:

| Layer | Tools | How They Are Used |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| **Structure & Layout** | **HTML5** | Provides semantic, accessible page structure for sections like *About Me*, *Skills*, *Experience*, and *Projects*. |
| **Styling & Responsiveness** | **CSS3** with modern layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid) | Delivers a clean, mobile-first design and smooth scaling across screen sizes. |
| **Interactivity & Logic** | **Vanilla JavaScript** (`script.js`) | Handles interactive elements‚Äîsmooth scrolling, section reveals, and form logic‚Äîwithout heavy frameworks for optimal speed. |
| **Assets & Media** | `assets/` directory | Stores images, icons, and documents, organized for efficient loading and caching. |
| **Version Control & Deployment** | **Git/GitHub + GitHub Pages** | Source code is tracked on GitHub. Pages automatically serves the site from the `main` branch with a custom domain. |
| **Domain & Security** | **Namecheap domain + HTTPS** | The domain [hrushibhatt.com](https://hrushibhatt.com) is secured with SSL/TLS for safe, professional access. |

This architecture ensures **instant page loads**, **low maintenance**, and a **future-proof foundation** that can grow as new projects and skills are added.
